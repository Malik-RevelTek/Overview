# Welcome to United Home

We use an Open Source BIM Approach along with [AutoDesk Software](https://www.autodesk.com/industry/aec/bim) to hold together State-of-the-Art Building Information Models for our collective properties.

We encourage anyone to fork our Repos to contribute.  You can also install the ZenHub extension to access our open-source tasks for our Open Source BIM Approach.

BIM or Building Information Modeling is a highly collaborative process allowing architects, engineers, contractors, and other industry professionals to design, document, visualize, and construct buildings ideally from a single digital model.
